# Task Manager Project  

## Description  
This project is a **Task Manager Web Application** developed as part of an internship submission. It allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks in an organized manner. The backend is built using **Flask** with **MongoDB** as the database, while the frontend uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. To enhance the project, an **AI-powered feature** using **TextBlob** is integrated, which processes user inputs and provides intelligent task title and description suggestions.  

## Key Features  
- Add and manage tasks with titles and descriptions.  
- Store and retrieve tasks using **MongoDB**.  
- AI-powered task input suggestion using **TextBlob**.  
- Simple and responsive **HTML/CSS/JS frontend**.  
- REST APIs built using **Flask** for communication between frontend and backend.  

## Intended Users  
- Students managing assignments or study tasks.  
- Professionals tracking work activities.  
- Anyone looking for a simple AI-powered to-do manager.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **AI/NLP**: TextBlob for task suggestions  

## Key Innovation  
The integration of an **AI/NLP angle** makes this task manager more than just a simple to-do app. By analyzing user inputs, it can generate or refine task details, helping users organize their work smarter and faster.  

## Potential Impact  
This project demonstrates how **AI + Web Development** can combine to improve productivity tools. It can be expanded with features like deadlines, reminders, or advanced AI integration, making it useful for a wide range of real-world task management scenarios.  

## How to Run  
1. Start **MongoDB server**:  
   ```bash
   mongod --dbpath C:\data\db
